    	We do not charge fees for selling or buying, eliminating costs that normally increase prices. We do not sell 
advertising space to outside advertisers; users usually think they are annoying. We only make money when a seller 
chooses to promote their product on our site. S2BXChange has built its own internal ad network, letting sellers 
decide if they want to spend to promote their products.

    	<div class="acontent">
    	This is our marketplace that tells buyers everything is for sale. To offer an item, it must be discounted from its 
original price. Listing an item requires paying for page placement. This means, these sellers are serious about 
moving merchandise. First, you decide the total amount you are willing to spend to market the item, then you select 
an amount you want to pay per time it is viewed, the more you spend to have the item viewed, the more likely the 
item will be seen. If you want to sell items faster, “On Sale Items” is the place to list your item.

    	There is no charge for listing the first 150 items in any 30-day period. There are no fees for selling any item. If you 
choose to offer more than 150 items in a 30-day period, you can either choose a listing package that offers more 
listings or open a Store Front.

        <strong>3 Easy Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Register</li>
            <li>Go to your dashboard and select Create a Product: Creating a product requires specific information about 
             the product, including photo, description of item, category selection, background information about the 
             product, and any other information that may help to sell the item.</li>
            <li>
             If at any time you want to sell the product, select List It: Choose price, type of sale (auction, auction with 
             hidden reserve price, or fixed price), time allotted for item to sell, shipping fees, amount of items available, 
             payment methods, and if you want to Promote Your Listing on the site. If auction is chosen as the method of 
             sale, you will need to decide the increments accepted for bids, the starting bid price, and if you want a 
             hidden reserve price - which requires the buyer to bid at least the reserve price for the auction to close.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        Promote Your Listing: S2BXChange offers an exciting opportunity for sellers to get maximum exposure for their 
items, by placing products for sale throughout the sites many pages.
        </p>
        <p>
        To promote your product, you need to purchase ad dollars for your Promotional Account, by selecting Promotional 
Account from your Dashboard. You can also add dollars to your Promotional Account when you decide to list an item. 
Once you have credit in your Promotional Account, you can now begin advertising. 
        </p>
        <p>
        First, set the total dollar amount you would like to budget for promoting your item. 
Second, select the amount you want to spend per page view. The system will tell you the most recent pay per view 
price paid for items, by levels of exposure. You can adjust your pay per view price accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
        S2BXChange offers sellers the option to put an item on sale through our "On Sale Items" section, S2B Plus. This 
requires discounting the normal fixed price and paying a fee for placement.  Simply set the dollar amount you would 
like to budget for placement and select the amount you want to pay per view. The system will tell you the most recent 
pay per view price paid for items, by levels of exposure. You can adjust your pay per view price accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you need to list more than 150 items in any 30-day period, you can choose from the following packages.  Payment 
is offset with bonus advertising dollars that we credit to your account.

    	Register, and then choose the item you want to purchase. If the item is being sold in an auction, place a bid based
 upon the criteria established by the seller for placing bids. Once the auction closes, if you are the highest bidder and 
there is no hidden reserve price, you have won the auction. If there is a hidden reserve price, your bid must match or 
exceed the reserve price for you to win the auction, provided you are the highest bidder when the auction closes. For 
fixed price items for sale, you need to pay the posted price.
Each item sold will indicate method of payment and shipping terms.
