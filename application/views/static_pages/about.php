    	<p>
    	LegacyXChange will change the way you value and purchase your collectibles, whether 
you are a serious collector or just want to own an item from your favorite sporting event. 
We are working with hundreds of athletes, active and retired, and their management, to 
help manage their brands. It all starts with controlling collectibles created by each 
athlete, by guaranteeing the market will not be flooded with counterfeits, and ensuring 
the athlete profits from every item related to their brand. LegacyXChange permanently 
marks every item created by the athlete, with technology that cannot be counterfeited 
but still can be easily identified. Buyers will take comfort in knowing each item created is 
tracked with a special code that stays with the owner of an item, just like a car registration, 
but can be transferred to new ownership at any time. If an item is stolen, it 
can be identified by law enforcement and returned to its rightful owner. 
</p>
<p>
Third party items claiming to have been signed by an athlete will require authentication 
from a LegacyXChange approved company.  We will not allow fraudulent items to be 
sold on our site. 
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to establish the first marketplace that guarantees Original and Third Party 
items are real, not counterfeit. We are excited about this challenge; we have engaged 
many of the leading experts in the industry, with over 100 years of highly reputable 
experience.

   <p> 	 	
    	Many online sites offering collectibles and memorabilia are open to all sellers without 
regard toward product authenticity; LegacyXChange intends to limit third party product 
availability based upon a new set of industry standards, including the exclusion of items 
claiming to be original signings that have not been evaluated for authenticity by one of 
our approved partners, rejection for questionable sellers that are known in their 
respective industries, and suspension of selling privileges upon negative feedback from 
buyers. The public's perception of integrity is paramount to our sites legitimacy. We do 
not charge fees for selling or buying, eliminating the standard online costs that are 
generally added into the retail price. We do not sell advertising space to outside 
advertisers; we generate revenue through own internal ad network, letting sellers decide 
if they want to spend to promote their products. 
</p> 	<p> 	
A seller can choose to promote their product on our site, through either a keyword-pay 
per click or pay per view advertising program, or both simultaneously. 
</p> 	<p> 	
We will make every effort to promote our site through a variety of means, including radio,
 print, television, and social media, and if our sellers offer the best products at the right 
prices, more people will come to the site to shop. 
</p> 	<p> 	
Plus, it's great to associate with a site that provides a 100% guarantee of authenticity 
when they purchase Original memorabilia.
<p> 	<p> 	
The Marketplace will showcase collectible and memorabilia items in Sports, 
Entertainment, Art, Books, Jewelry, Watches, Antiques, Stamps, Coins, and Fashion. 
Items will be offered at set prices or in auctions.

seller, you decide the total amount you are willing to spend to market the item, then you 
select an amount you want to pay per view, the more you spend for pay per view, the 
more likely the item will be seen and possibly sold. If you want to sell items faster,

    	LegacyXChange has created the ultimate online platform for active and retired athletes 
and celebrities, to ensure their brands maintain the highest integrity and value.
</p>
<p>
Athletes and Celebrities sign thousands of items over the course of their careers, 
generally receiving very little or no revenue. Once they are retired, they continue to see 
memorabilia and collectibles associated with their name; however, they are almost 
always traded with no payment to the athlete or celebrity. Making matters worse, many 
of the items are counterfeit, lowering the value of their brand.
</p>
<p>
Using world-class technology, athletes and celebrities can now control their brand 
integrity. We offer a complete turnkey solution, allowing you to dictate the value of your 
brand, assuring buyers 100% authenticity of your collectible.
